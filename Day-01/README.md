# **DAY 01: CLOUD COMPUTING FUNDAMENTALS**

---

## **1. WHAT IS VIRTUALIZATION?** 🖥️
Before the cloud, hardware was inefficient. **Virtualization** is the technology that makes Cloud Computing possible. It uses a **Hypervisor** to allow one physical server to run multiple **Virtual Machines (VMs)**.

* **Host:** The physical hardware (CPU, RAM).
* **Hypervisor:** The software layer (e.g., Microsoft Hyper-V).
* **Guest:** The Virtual Machine running its own OS.

## **2. CLOUD COMPUTING DEFINED** ☁️
Cloud computing is the delivery of IT resources over the internet with **Pay-as-you-go** pricing.

### **Key Benefits:**
* **Scalability:** Ability to handle more load.
* **Elasticity:** Automatically growing or shrinking based on demand.
* **High Availability:** Ensuring your app is always accessible.
* **Agility:** Speed of deploying resources (seconds vs. weeks).

---

## **3. REGIONS AND AVAILABILITY ZONES** 🌍
* **Region:** A geographical area containing at least one (but usually multiple) data centers.
* **Availability Zone (AZ):** Physically separate data centers within an Azure region.
    * *Why?* If one data center has a fire or power outage, your app stays running in another AZ.

## **4. CAPEX VS. OPEX** 💸
* **CapEx (Capital Expenditure):** High upfront cost. You buy the hardware.
* **OpEx (Operational Expenditure):** No upfront cost. You pay for what you use (Subscription based).

---

## **5. SHARED RESPONSIBILITY MODEL** 🤝
In the cloud, you and Microsoft share the work:
* **Microsoft manages:** The physical building, the hardware, and the cables.
* **You manage:** The data, the user accounts (passwords), and the application settings.
